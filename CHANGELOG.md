# Kasia Changelog

- __v3.0.0__ - _31/08/16_

    - [BREAKING] Fix bug in Universal Application solution that prevented components picking 
    up prepared query data on the client. Also involves change in API that means `ConnectComponent.makePreloader` returns array
    immediately instead of a function. ([#24](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/24))
    - Improved test coverage of universal application solution. ([#26](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/26))
    - Additional utility export `kasia/util`, currently only exporting `makePreloaderSaga()` for use with server-side rendering.
    - Improved developer feedback. ([#4](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/4), [#24](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/23))
    - Updates to README: better documentation of Universal Application solution. ([#25](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/25))
    - Update to latest version of Jest.

- __v2.4.0__ - _10/08/16_

    - Mixin `node-wpapi`'s available mixins to internal calls to `registerRoute` by default in order

    - Fix functions passed as props to `connectWpQuery` causing infinite dispatching.
    ([#16](https://github.com/outlandishideas/kasia/issues/16))
    - Added second parameter `propsComparatorFn` to `connectWpQuery`.
    - Fix `connectWpPost` derived query chaining failing due to dependency on object property order.

- __v1.0.2__ - _04/08/16_

    - Removed `postinstall` npm script because it runs before dependencies are installed(?!).

- __v1.0.1__ - _04/08/16_

    - Fix bad import statements (see next bullet).
    - Rename `ContentTypes.js` -> `contentTypes.js` as this was causing an error on
