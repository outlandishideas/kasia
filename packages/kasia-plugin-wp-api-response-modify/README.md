## The Shape of Things

With this plugin Kasia restructures the [shape of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn2JFlteeJ0) returned from the WP-API.

The changes made to the data are all effects available in the
[`wp-api-response-modify`](https://github.com/outlandishideas/wp-api-response-modify) library.

### Why?

The JSON returned from WP-API contains such things as objects with a single property (e.g. objects with `rendered`)
and meta data property names prefixed with an underscore (e.g. `_links`).

### What changes should I be aware of?

- All property names are camel-cased.

    ```js
    "featured_media" => "featuredMedia"
    ```

- Links are removed.

    ```js
    { title: 'Wow what an amazing title!', _links: {}, ... }
    // becomes...
    { title: 'Wow what an amazing  title!', ... }
    ```

- Objects that have a single property `'rendered'` are flattened.

    ```js
    { content: { rendered: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>' }, ... }
    // becomes...
    { content: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>', ... }
    ```

- Content types are normalised using [`normalizr`](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr).
This means that any embedded content data is made available on the store within its respective content type collection.
For example:

    ```js
    {
      posts: {},
      users: {},
      pages: {},
      news: {}, // custom content type
      ...
    }
    ```
